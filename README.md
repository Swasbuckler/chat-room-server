# This is a Real Time Chat Application with React and Python

This project was inspired by a YouTube video from Tech With Tim called "[Python Live Chat Room Tutorial Using Flask & SocketIO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkXdvs8H7TA)" where Python was solely used to create the Chat Application.\
It is a Full Stack Application with React as the Frontend and a Python Backend using Flask for the Backend Server and SocketIO from the Real Time Connection.

## What have I Achieved and Learnt through this Project

Creating the Chat Application had taught me a lot with both React and Python Backend Development.

For the Frontend, I was able to play around with React development and using certain packages to provide the needed features to make a cohesive product. With React Router, Reack Hook Form and SocketIO-Client providing application functionalities and TailwindCSS for easy stylings. I will be able to bring my experience using these packages to other projects.

On the Python side, as it was my first time creating a Python server, I had experienced a number of setbacks while using the Flask API and Flask-SocketIO. Connecting the SocketIO-Client on React and the Backend had brought some difficulties however these struggles allowed me to get to know of key faults and issues I would face in the future if I were to make use of these libraries and packages.

By the end, I was able to develop a working real time chat room application.

## Packages Used for the Application

1. React v19 | For the Frontend Framework
2. React Router Dom | Browser Router and Single Page Application
3. React Hook Form | Form Control
4. TailwindCSS | CSS Styling
5. SocketIO | For Real Time Connection
6. Flask & Flask-SocketIO | To create Python server and Real Time Connection

## Videos of the Application
